Ok, so I'm blowing the heap. Time to do some estimations about how much memory
keeping all the possible combination of mixtures in memory at once.

Using the binomial coefficient we know that there are 100!/(4!*96!)=3,921,225
different way to mix the ingredients. That is almost 4 million!

If we only store the signature, as a string, we would have 43 bytes as a median
size. We are assuming the count takes 2 characters and that every character fits
in 1 byte. The outlier were one ingredient would be 100 (3 bytes) can be
discounted for the purpose of estimation, since it would mean the other counts
are 0 (1 byte).

Sprinkles: 9
Butterscotch: 12
Chocolate: 9
Candy: 5
(+ 9 12 9 5 (* 2 4)) 43 bytes

(* 3921225 43) 168612675 Bytes which is
/1024 is â‰… 164660 KiB
/1024 is â‰… 169 MiB
So we should be able to fit everything in memory. ðŸ¤”

The reason why would be because I'm starting from an empty bag and start
branching out, keeping track of all the paths seen across the way. That would
blow up the amount of memory required. Another approach would be to to start
from one possible complete mix, and branch from there through the possible
permutations.

Because every combination we are going to look at is a complete mix we can use
the seen map to keep track of the bag-score.
